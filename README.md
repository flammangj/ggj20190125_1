This is the correct branch.

There is so much hidden work in the game that we added in the polish phase and some bugs that could have been smartly fixed. Which means there are still so many things unsaid.

At this point I have a vague idea of how long my wife would have taken if I not unticked a checkbox in the project settings. There are many subtle game design decisions that could easily be overseen.

* The symbols are your tutorial
* There are still unintended glitches in the game
* There is increasing challenge
* For some bugs I had plans, but there was no time to exploit the glitches for more fun
* Be used to repetition
* Thanks Stanley Parable for the inspiration (but only during the polish, 10 hours before end)
* Yes, I'm serious about mental challenge.

* Also, what I would like to tell my dear team members, and I left unspoken: if you want to do a second jam and try to exploit the "Video World" for an even better platformer puzzle game, I'm sure we could arrange something.
